              <h2>Why CozyLink?</h2>
              <p>CozyLink is a student startup aimed to tackle the fragmented, inefficient, and often unreliable rental process that many young adults, specifically students, face. The app itself is meant to create centralization by enabling students to search and discover reliable rentals without needing to consult external platforms and connect with other verified users, including renters, landlords, and tenants.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As the founding designer, I designed the entire app from scratch and created our visual identity. My designs focus on the renter account since I didn’t get to the lister account before the project ended.</p>

              <h2>Research Methods</h2>
              <p>In order to validate the need for our app, I collaborated with a few teammates to create a market research survey to gauge students’ experiences with the housing rental process. The questions ranged from how they discover properties to begin with to what could have improved their experiences. After distributing our survey, we interviewed some of the respondents. I also did my own research on popular rental apps in market to kick off my designs.</p>

          <h2>Home / Initial Wireframes</h2>
          <p>While wireframing, I struggled with understanding the app’s vision. The homepage aimed to link to the roommate finder, subleasing, and subletting pages. However, I found some key issues: the distinction between subleasing and subletting was unclear, and there was significant overlap between the roommates and landing pages.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="/images/cozylink/home-lo-fi-annotated.png">
        <p>I initially interpreted the roommate board as for users who had secured rentals and were seeking roommates, rather than those who formed housing groups before the search. Additionally, there was no clear way for users to access the roommate questionnaire or rental posting form.</p>

          <h2>⚠️ Overcoming a Major Roadblock: Redesigning for Diverse User Needs</h2>
          <p>Since the team aimed to combine listing and renting functionalities within a single account, I designed with this approach in mind. However, this solution fell short of addressing the diverse needs of our users. While my iterations improved in meeting renter expectations, they struggled to effectively cater to all user types—renter, sublessor, and landlord—due to the difficulty of consolidating multiple functionalities into one account.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The forms, like the roommate questionnaire and property listing form, served different purposes for various user types. Renters needed the questionnaire once, sublessors used the listing form occasionally, and landlords required it multiple times. As a result, placing these forms in a quick actions button or grouping them within one account proved inefficient.</p>
        <div class="info-card dark">
          <p class="subheading">📝 Revisiting my research</p>
          <p>After revisiting my competitor analysis, I concluded that <strong>a complete reorganization of the app was necessary</strong>. All the 7 platforms I analyzed had separate renter/guest and lister/host accounts for a good reason, which I found out the hard way. As a result, I needed to <strong>separate landlord and renter functionalities</strong> to better address the unique needs and functionalities of each user type.</p>
        </div>
        <p>While I didn’t end up getting to work on the lister account, I concentrated on tailoring the renter account to better meet renter needs.</p>

          <h2>CozyLink Site Map</h2>
          <p>After having multiple discussions with my team regarding the restructure, I created a site map to organize our ideas and understand the interactions within the primary navigation. This new navigation includes: Home (defaulting to rental units with a toggle for roommates), Messages, Community 🆕, Starred, and Profile.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="/images/cozylink/site-map.png">
        <p>Unfortunately, I didn’t work on the Community section since it was added towards the end of the project. Since younger student renters often see living off-campus as a step toward adulthood, the Community page would have been valuable for helping them acclimate to their new city and connect with other young adults through interest groups and local events.</p>
        <p>I also had limited time to work on the Profile page, which would have included a way for users to switch between rental and landlord/lister accounts, either at the bottom of the page or through a long-press.</p>

          <h2>Onboarding Flow</h2>
          <p>Right off the bat, I wanted to minimize the amount of steps it takes for a user to reach the home page where they can view rentals while still having enough information in the backend to provide them with a complete homepage.</p>
        </div>  
        <p>At the team's request, I made the first screen an optional sign-up page. Since we likely wouldn't have enough listings on our app to create an Airbnb-like homepage with appealing non-location-based listings, I added a required location field to the onboarding screens.</p>
        <img src="/images/cozylink/onboarding-flow.png">
        <p>After mapping out user flows for both new users (create an account or continue as a guest) and existing users, I developed detailed flows for each scenario. While creating an account can be cumbersome, it is essential for users who want to do more than just browse, share, or star properties.</p>

            <p>Given that the housing process is often cumbersome and draining, my goal was to enhance the experience by integrating more fun and engaging elements. I decided to incorporate social media-like elements into the app such as:</p>

            <li>Adding a customizable roommate profile card section in addition to the more tedious roommate questionnaire as part of the Roommate Profile creation process</li>

          <h3>Changes to the Roommate Profile Card</h3>
          <p>First, I needed to make some critical changes to our existing roommate profile card, as it plays a vital role in the app. I had previously identified issues with its visual appeal and the content, which was heavily focused on logistics and failed to capture the user's personality and interests—key factors in fostering connections that could turn a roommate into a friend</p>
        </div>
        <img src="/images/cozylink/roommate-card-changes.png">
        <p>While working on this, I recognized an opportunity to expand the app's use beyond renters to also support students living on-campus who are seeking roommates, as finding a compatible roommate is challenging regardless of living situation.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Don't strive for perfection</strong>: My younger self would have never thought I'd say this. However, our strive for perfection severely hindered our progress. We aimed to create a flawless product rather than focusing on a MVP and allowing user testing to guide the rest of the product. We should have prioritized key features and planned releases more effectively instead of trying to launch everything at once.</li>
              <li><strong>Focus on the overall experience</strong>: I spent an excessive amount of time on minor design aesthetics rather than on the overall user experience. This led to missing important edge cases and interaction details during prototyping. It’s crucial to balance visual design with usability to ensure a comprehensive and functional user experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Align on goals early</strong>: We often found ourselves misaligned on goals and lacked a comprehensive brainstorming session at the beginning of the project. Holding such a session would have helped us clarify objectives and set a unified direction. I would advocate for early goal alignment and collaborative planning in future projects.</li>
              <li><strong>Invest in discovery and definition</strong>: I would allocate more time to the discovery and definition phases of a project. This includes interviewing both renters and landlords, developing detailed user flows, and creating wireframes before moving on to mid to high-fidelity designs. Thorough exploration and definition of user needs and workflows are essential for creating a well-rounded and effective design.</li>
