While the project ended up being highly collaborative at all stages, I played a key role in designing the lo-fi wireframes, high-fi mockups, and prototypes, and I took full responsibility for developing the style guide.</p>

            <p>Zest is a B2B corporate gifting integration used by brands to allow gift purchasers maximize product range, discounts, and customization options. In order for users to reach this site, the gift purchaser visits a brand‚Äôs website, finds the corporate gifting landing page usually embedded in the footer, and opens the corporate gift shop powered by Zest.</p>

              <p>Currently, Zest offers two shipping methods: shipping to recipients' addresses and sending e-gifts.

              <h2>Sketches</h2>
              <p>We began by individually brainstorming different approaches to implementing bulk shipping.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div>
                <img src="/images/zest/sketches-1.png">

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>After reviewing our sketches as a team, we identified several key patterns we wanted to incorporate into the designs:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The bulk shipping option should naturally be placed in the Delivery Method section.</li>
              <li>Selecting bulk shipping should trigger a change in the interface.</li>
              <li>A sticky cart with a clear per-recipient total should be included for transparency</li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, there were still questions around how users should select the bulk shipping option. Our ideas ranged from using a simple drop-down to differentiating between e-gift and physical shipping before narrowing down to bulk or individual shipments.</p>

            <div class="gap-sm">
              <h2>Lo-fi</h2>
              <p>When discussing where to place the bulk shipping option, we considered creating a third delivery method but felt this was an overly simplistic solution that didn't fit seamlessly into the existing interface. Instead, we chose to incorporate it under the 'ship to recipients‚Äô addresses' option to maintain consistency.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>We updated the recipients‚Äô list to exclude multiple addresses, as this naturally followed from shipping the entire order to one location.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I suggested adding a sticky shopping cart during our previous sketching session to address a potential pain point: users currently have to click 'Review and Checkout' to trigger a modal that displays their order total. By implementing a sticky cart, we would be able to reduce unnecessary back-and-forth navigation.</p>

              <h2>Client Feedback</h2>
              <p>After sharing our lo-fi wireframes with Zest‚Äôs founding designer, Christine, her feedback prompted us to reconsider our designs.</p>

                <img src="/images/zest/delivery-method-lofi.png">
                <p>We initially put the bulk shipping option under the existing "ship to recipients' addresses" as a way of grouping both physical delivery methods. However, Christine's feedback informed us that  the new bulk shipping method operates more differently than we thought, so grouping it with the existing physical delivery method would not make sense.</p>

                <img src="/images/zest/delivery-method-hifi.png">
                <p>As a result, we added a third delivery method in our hi-fi. Having a drop-down of a ship to multiple addresses vs. ship to one address not only required more clicks but could also lead to confusing behavior after the selection. Therefore, a third option provided clarity and reduced friction in the user experience.</p>

                    <p>Although the sticky cart was outside our initial scope, Christine really liked the idea.

            <p>We were also asked to consider adding a way for users to select and edit the number of recipients through the cart. Since we had already implemented a counter in the recipients field, it was an easy addition to the cart.</p>

              <li><strong>Expand your scope but maintain focus</strong>: While it's essential to be flexible and adapt the project scope as needed, keeping the project within defined parameters helps in maintaining focus and managing complexity. This balance was crucial in integrating the new bulk shipping feature effectively while respecting the existing user experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Keep collaborators informed</strong>: Regularly update all team members and stakeholders to optimize time and effort. Keeping Christine, especially, and Jeremy informed throughout the process ensured that our designs were on the right track and allowed us to easily incorporate their feedback.</li>
              <li><strong>Prioritize user testing</strong>: User feedback is incredibly valuable for validating and refining designs. Although our project timeline was limited, and we couldn‚Äôt conduct user testing, we recognized its importance through feedback from our client.</li>
