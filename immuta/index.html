              <h2>A Quick Overview of Policies</h2>
              <p>Immuta has two types of policies, subscription and data. Subscription policies grant users read access, which enables viewing access to data, or write access, which enables both viewing and editing access. Data policies work in tandem with subscription policies and limit the amount of information users see.</p>
            </div>
            <p>From the general policy list view, the user can add a policy through the global policy builder.</p>
            <img src="/images/immuta/global-subscription-policy-builder.png">
            <p>After completing the policy builder, the user can activate or stage their policy. Depending on their selection, the policy is displayed at the top of the policy list and is assigned one of three statuses:</p>

            <div class="gap-sm">
              <h2>Policy enforcement feels automatic when it's really not.</h2>
              <p>When users create or modify policies in the platform, it often seems as though these changes are applied instantly. However, in reality, the process could take hours, especially if the policy affects hundreds of data sources or users. Since this delay is not communicated clearly, users remain uncertain about when their changes will take effect.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Additionally, if a policy fails during synchronization, there's no indication of this failure in the UI, making it nearly impossible for users to pinpoint and troubleshoot errors. Instead, they must contact Customer Success, who then reaches out to Product, who diagnoses the issue.</p>
            <p>This lack of transparency leaves users frustrated and adds inefficiency to their workflow.</p>

            <h2>Navigating Early Stage Design</h2>
            <p>Since it was my first time designing a dashboard, I referenced many of our existing overview pages and tweaked existing visualizations for my needs. While I wasn’t a fan of the old graphs, I struggled to devise the best way to present the following information, given the lack of clear requirements.</p>
            <img src="/images/immuta/overview-iteration-1.png">
            <p>As I worked, I noticed that most of our existing overview pages didn’t link to other areas, despite being dashboards. Following that pattern, I initially designed without actionable elements in mind.</p>
            <p>However, I was soon prompted to reconsider this approach when I received this feedback:</p>
            <div class="quote-container immuta">
              <p>“We should focus on what is actionable, however, to make sure the user gets value out of it beyond ‘this is a cool/interesting dashboard’”</p>

          <p>In my previous iteration, I placed a failed synchronizations list at the bottom of the page. However, this required users to scroll down to see their issues rather than being able to see them immediately. I revised this by changing it to a banner at the top of the page.</p>

          <p>While I believed this change made sense, the PMs found the logic confusing and felt it wasn't efficient enough for users.</p>

            <h2>How might we enable users to quickly understand the status of their policies and take appropriate actions?</h2>
            <p>I designed a new overview page to better integrate existing parts of our platform, rather than creating new, separate pages. This overview aligns with our current pages, as shown in the site map, and provides users with a clear snapshot of their policies before exploring individual policy types.</p>

            <h2>How might we provide clear and intuitive interfaces for action triggers and status indicators?</h2>
            <p>In order to address this question, I revamped our policy list view by:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Completely redesigning our status column to indicate clear policy statuses and better align with a new status column design by a fellow designer
              </li>
              <li>
                Moving secondary information into a new expand / collapse column
              </li>
              <li>
                Adding different states to the Action column
              </li>

            <div class="col-2-3 gap-md">
              <p>The original status column lacked states and clarity, and while the animated spinner indicated an ongoing process, it was confusing when paired with the word "ACTIVE."</p>
              <p>I explored several iterations, using various combinations of icons and text for status flags. I was eventually inspired by the way a fellow designer used icon-less flags and instead introduced a new column with icon buttons, which provided more details on hover. This solution was optimal for my work given the range of error types that can occur when a policy fails.</p>

            <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Prioritize flow over fidelity</strong>: I realized that focusing on high-fidelity designs without first understanding the user flows is counterproductive. It’s crucial to take a step back and think from a high-level perspective before diving into detailed designs. This approach helps prevent misalignment and ensures a more cohesive and effective user experience.</li>

              <li><strong>Understand the bigger picture</strong>: I also learned to consider how my work fits into the larger product ecosystem. As a result, I began to evaluate the broader impact of introducing new design patterns in my work and realized that my contributions were not isolated, but rather interconnected with the rest of the product</li>
            </ol>

              <h2>Internship Learnings</h2>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Don't get too attached</strong>: It’s important not to get too attached to your designs. While they may look fine from a design perspective, they often require adjustments once reviewed by PMs and engineers, who provide additional insights about users, the product, and feasibility.</li>
  
                <li><strong>Effective organization and documentation</strong>: Thanks to the design team, I learned the importance of annotating designs and preparing detailed presentations for stakeholder meetings. This practice not only reduces confusion but also helps identify logical gaps in the work beforehand.</li>
  
                <li><strong>Frequent sharing</strong>: I discovered the value of regularly sharing my work with teammates and stakeholders, even while projects are ongoing. Keeping everyone updated helps align efforts and facilitates valuable feedback, contributing to a more cohesive and improved product.</li>
              </ol> 
              <p>Lastly, a huge thank you to everyone who supported me this summer—especially Peter and the rest of the UX Design team including Kenlee, Karla, and Josh, my project collaborators, and those who made the 1.5-hour commute worthwhile.</p>
